# ðŸ“• Web Almanac

The Web Almanac is HTTP Archive's annual "state of the web" report. Our mission is to combine the powerful analytics of HTTP Archive with the expertise of the web community. The Almanac is made up of four primary sections: page content, user experience, content delivery, and content distribution. Each section is comprised of chapters that explore the state of specific areas like JavaScript usage, accessibility, content management systems, and compression.

## Contributing

We are currently developing the inaugural 2019 edition of the Almanac and looking for contributors to help in the following areas:

- [Subject matter experts](https://github.com/HTTPArchive/almanac.httparchive.org/issues/2) to lead each chapter and provide a written interpretation of the dataset.
- [Peer reviewers](https://github.com/HTTPArchive/almanac.httparchive.org/issues/2) to assist the chapter authors with planning and editing.
- [Data analysts](https://github.com/HTTPArchive/almanac.httparchive.org/issues/23) to query the HTTP Archive dataset for metrics used by each chapter.
- [Web designers and developers](https://github.com/HTTPArchive/almanac.httparchive.org/issues/24) to help build the UX of the Almanac itself.
- [Translators](https://github.com/HTTPArchive/almanac.httparchive.org/issues/29) to bring the Almanac content to as many popular languages as possible

We strive to make the Web Almanac an inclusive and diverse project. If you bring a unique perspective, we want to hear from you. For example, members of the web community from underrepresented groups or those with unique experiences like standards work, browser development, framework development, etc bring a valuable set of diverse perspectives and are highly encouraged to participate.
