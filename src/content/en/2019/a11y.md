# What is web accessibility and why does it matter?

Accessibility on the Web is essential for an inclusive and equitable society. As more of our social and work lives move to the online world, it becomes all the more important for people with disabilities to be able to participate in all online interactions without barriers. Just as building architects can create or omit accessibility features such as wheelchair ramps, web developers can help or hinder assistive technology users depending on the level of accessibility support integrated into a website.

When thinking about users with disabilities, we should remember that their user journeys are often the same, but they utilize different tools. These popular tools include but are not limited to: screen readers, screen magnifiers, browser or text size zooming, captions, voice controls, and color perception differences.

Often, improving the accessibility of your webpage has benefits for everyone. While we typically think of people with disabilities as people with a permanent disability, everybody can have a temporary or situational disability. For example, someone might be permanently blind, or temporarily have an eye infection, or situationally be outside on a sunny day. All of these might explain why someone is unable to see their screen. Everyone has situational disabilities, and so improving the accessibility of your web page will improve the experience of all users in any situation.

# State of accessibility support around the web

The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) (WCAG) advise on how to make a website accessible. These guidelines were used as the basis for our analysis. However, in many cases it is difficult to programmatically analyze how accessible a website is. For instance, the web platform provides several ways of achieving similar functional results, but the underlying code that powers them may be completely different. Therefore, our analysis is just an approximation of how accessible the Web is.

We’ve split up our most interesting insights into three categories: Ease of reading, ease of page navigation, and compatibility with assistive technologies.

**_Note:_** We did not find any significant difference in accessibility when testing on desktop vs. mobile. As a result, all of our presented metrics are the result of our **desktop** analysis unless otherwise stated.

# Ease of reading

The primary goal of a webpage is to deliver content users want to engage with. This content might be a video or an assortment of images, but many times, it’s simply the text on the page. It’s extremely important that our textual content is legible to our readers. If visitors can’t read a webpage, then they can’t engage with it, and they’ll leave. In this section we’ll look at three areas in which sites struggled.

## Color contrast

There are many cases in which website visitors may not be able to see a website perfectly. Visitors may be colorblind and unable to distinguish between the font and background color ([1 in every 12 men](https://web.archive.org/web/20180304115406/http://www.allpsych.uni-giessen.de/karl/colbook/sharpe.pdf)[ and 1 in 200 women](https://web.archive.org/web/20180304115406/http://www.allpsych.uni-giessen.de/karl/colbook/sharpe.pdf) of European descent). Perhaps they’re simply reading while the sun is out and creating tons of glare on their screen—significantly impairing their vision. Or maybe they’ve just grown older, and their eyes can't distinguish colors as well as they used to.

To allow your users to be able to read your website under these conditions, be sure that your text has sufficient color contrast with its background.

![image alt text](image_0.png)

So how well did the sites we analyzed do? **Only 22.04%** of sites gave all of their text sufficient color contrast. Or in other words: 4 out of every 5 sites have text that easily blends into the background, making it unreadable.

**_Note:_** Because we were unable to analyze text when it has an image as a background, we gave all of these instances a passing grade. This means our reported metric is an upper-bound of the total number of websites that pass the color contrast test.

## Zooming and scaling pages

Using a [readable font size](https://accessibleweb.com/question-answer/minimum-font-size/) and [target size](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#target-size) helps users read and interact with your website. But even websites that follow these guidelines perfectly cannot always meet the needs of each visitor. Device features like pinch-to-zoom and scaling allow users to tweak your pages so their needs are met. Or in the case of inaccessible sites using 10px font and tiny little buttons… it gives users the chance to even use the site.

There are rare cases when disabling scaling is acceptable, like when the page in question is a web-based game using touch controls. If left enabled in this case, players’ phones will zoom in and out every time the player taps twice on the game, ironically making it inaccessible.

Because of this, developers are given the ability to disable this feature by setting one of the following two properties in the [meta viewport tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag):

1. *user-scalable* set to *0* or *no*

2. *maximum-scale* set to *1*, *1.0*, etc

Developers have misused this so much that **one out of every three sites on mobile** (33.07%) disable this feature, and Apple no longer allows web-developers to disable zooming (as of iOS 10, [Safari browser simply ignores the tag](https://archive.org/details/ios-10-beta-release-notes)). All sites, no matter what, can be zoomed and scaled on newer iOS devices.

Unless your site is a very special case, remove user-scalable and maximum-scale from your meta viewport tag.

![image alt text](image_1.png)

*Figure 2. What percentage of sites disable zooming and scaling*

Alt text: Figure 2. What percentage of sites disable zooming and scaling. 33.07% of sites have zooming and scaling disabled on mobile devices, and 25.18% do on desktop.

## Language identification

The web is full of wondrous amounts of content. There’s just one catch: over 1000 different languages exist in the world, and the content you’re looking for may not be written in one you are fluent in. In recent years, we’ve made great strides in translation technologies and you probably have used one of them on the web (e.g., Google translate).

In order to facilitate this feature, the translation engines need to know what language your pages are written in. This is done by using the ["lang" ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang)[attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang). Without this, computers must guess what language your page is written in. As you might imagine, this leads to many errors, especially when pages use multiple languages (e.g., your page navigation is in English, but the post content is in Japanese).

This problem is even more pronounced on text-to-speech assistive technologies like screen readers, where if no language has been specified… they tend to read the text in the default user language.

Of the pages analyzed, **26.13% do not specify a language** with the *lang *attribute. This leaves over a quarter of pages susceptible to all of the problems described above. The good news? Of sites using the *lang* attribute, they specify a valid language code correctly **99.68% of the time**.

# Ease of page navigation

When you open the menu in a restaurant, the first thing you probably do is read all of the section headers: appetizers, salads, main course, dessert. This allows you to scan a menu for all of the options and jump quickly to the dishes that are most interesting to you. Similarly, when a visitor opens a web page, their goal is to find the information they are most interested in; the reason they came to the page in the first place. In order to help users find their desired content as fast as possible (and prevent them from hitting the back button), we try to separate the contents of our pages into several visually distinct sections. For example: a site header for navigation; various headings in our articles so users can quickly scan them; a footer for other extraneous resources; the list goes on.

While this is exceptionally important, we need to take care to mark up our pages so our visitors’ computers can *"see"* these distinct sections as well. Why? While most of us use a mouse to navigate pages, many others rely on keyboards and screen readers. These technologies rely heavily on how well their computers understand your page.

So how well are we doing? Very poorly. **Only 26.03% of sites** even contained the most basic part of navigation: a [main landmark](#heading=h.23wv35354sk) 😞.

## Headings

Headings are not only helpful visually, but to screen readers as well. They allow screen readers to quickly jump from section to section, and help indicate where one section ends and another begins.

In order to avoid confusing screen reader users, make sure you never skip a heading level. For example, don’t go straight from an H1 directly to an H3, and skip the H2. Why is this a big deal? Because this is an unexpected change that will cause a screen reader user to think they missed a piece of content. This might cause them to start looking all over for what they may have missed.. even if there isn’t anything missing. You’ll help all of your readers by keeping a more consistent design.

With that being said, here are our results:

1. **89.36% of pages** use headings in some fashion. Awesome 😃

2. **38.6% of pages** do skip heading levels (e.g., an h3 following an h1, with no h2 in between)

3. Strangely, H2s are found on more sites than H1s…

Alt text: A chart describing showing, for each of the following heading levels, what percentage of sites use them: H1: 63.25%; H2: 67.86%; H3: 58.63%; H4: 36.38%; H5: 14.64%; H6: 6.91%

## Main landmark

A [main landmark](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Main_role) indicates to screen readers where the main content of a webpage starts so users can jump right to it. Without this, screen reader users have to manually skip over your navigation every single time they go to a new page within your site. Obviously, this is rather frustrating.

We found **only one in every four pages** (26.03%) include a main landmark. And surprisingly, **8.06% of pages** erroneously contained more than one main landmark... leaving these users guessing which landmark contains the actual main content. So make sure to double check you have exactly one!

![image alt text](image_2.png)

Alt text: A chart describing showing the percentage of sites containing exactly this many main landmarks: Zero: 73.97%; One: 17.97%; Two: 7.41%; Three: 0.15%; 4: 0.06%

## HTML section elements

Since HTML5 was released in 2008, and was made the official standard in 2014, there are many HTML elements to aid computers and screen readers in understanding our page layout and structure.

Elements like [<header>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header), [<footer>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer), [<navigation>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav), and [<main>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main) indicate where specific types of content live and allow users to quickly jump around your page. These are being used pretty widely across the web, with most of them being used on over **50% of pages** (<main> being the outlier).

Others like [<article>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article), [<hr>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/hr), and [<aside>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside) aid readers in understanding a page’s main content. For example, <article> says where one article ends and another begins. These elements are not used nearly as much, which each sitting at around **20% usage**. Not all of these belong on every webpage, so this isn’t necessarily an alarming statistic.

All of these elements are primarily designed for accessibility support and have no visual effect. This means that you can safely replace existing elements with them with no unintended consequences.

![image alt text](image_3.png)

*Figure 3. Usage of various HTML semantic elements.*

Alt text: A chart describing showing, for each of the following semantic elements, what percentage of sites use them: nav: 53.94%; header: 54.82%; footer: 55.92%; main: 18.47%; aside: 16.99%; article: 22.59%; hr: 19.1%; section: 36.55%

## Other HTML elements used for navigation

Many popular screen readers also allow users to navigate by quickly jumping through links, lists, list items, iframes, and form fields like edit fields, buttons, and list boxes. Figure 4 details how often we saw pages using these elements.

![image alt text](image_4.png)

*Figure 4. Other HTML elements used for navigation*

Alt text: A chart describing showing, for each of the following elements, what percentage of sites use them: a: 98.22%; ul: 88.62%; input: 76.63%; iframe: 60.39%; button: 56.74%; select: 19.68%; textarea: 12.03%

## Skip Links

A [skip link](https://webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/) is a link placed at the top of a page which allows screen readers or keyboard-only users to jump straight to the main content. It effectively "skips" over all navigational links and menus at the top of the page. Skip links are especially useful to keyboard users who don't use a screen reader, as these users don’t usually have access to other modes of quick navigation (like ARIA landmarks and headings). **14.19%** of the pages in our sample were found to have skip links.

If you’d like to see a skip link in action for yourself, you can! Just do a quick google search and hit "tab" as soon as you land on the search result pages. You’ll be greeted with a previously hidden link just like the one in Figure 5.

![image alt text](image_5.png)

*Figure 5. What a skip link looks like on google.com*

**_Note:_** It’s hard to accurately determine what a skip link is when analyzing sites. For this analysis, if we found an anchor link (href=#heading1) within the first 3 links on the page, we defined this as a page with a skip link. So this 14.19% we reported is an upper bound and could be far worse.

## Shortcuts

Shortcut keys set via the *[aria-keyshortcut*s](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-keyshortcuts) or *[accesske*y](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/accesskey) attributes can be used in one of two ways:

1. Activating an element on the page, like a link or button.

2. Giving a certain element on the page focus. For example, shifting focus to a certain input on the page, allowing a user to then start typing into it.

Use of *[aria-keyshortcut*s](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-keyshortcuts) was almost absent from our sample, with it only being used on **only 159 sites out of over 4 million **analyzed. The *[accesske*y](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/accesskey) attribute was used more frequently, being found on **2.47% of webpages** (1.74% on mobile). We believe the higher usage of shortcuts on desktop is due to developers expecting mobile sites to only be accessed via a touch screen and not a keyboard.

What was especially surprising here is **13% of mobile and 15.5% of desktop **sites that use shortcut keys assign the same shortcut to multiple different elements. This means browsers have to guess which element should be the one to own this shortcut key.

## Tables

Tables are one of the primary ways we organize and express large amounts of data. Many assistive technologies like screen readers and switches (which may be used by users with motor disabilities) might have special features that allow them to navigate this tabular data more efficiently.

### Headings

Depending on the way a particular table is structured, the use of table headers makes it easier to read across columns or rows without losing context on what data that particular column or row refers to. Having to navigate a table lacking in header rows or columns is a subpar experience for a screen reader user. This is because it’s hard for a screen reader user to keep track of their place in a table that is absent of headers, especially when that table is quite large.

To mark up table headers, simply use the [<th>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/th) tag (instead of [<td>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/td)), or either of the ARIA ["columnheader](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Table_Role)[" or “](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Table_Role)[rowheader](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Table_Role)[”](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Table_Role) roles. Only **24.5% of pages** with tables were found to markup their tables with either of these methods. So the three quarters of pages choosing to include tables without headers are creating serious challenges for screen reader users.

**_Note:_** The use of *columnheader* and *rowheader* roles was almost non-existent with only 677 total sites using them (0.058% of the over 4 million we analyzed).

### Captions

Table captions via the [<caption>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/caption) element are helpful in giving more context, for readers of all kinds. A caption can prepare a reader to take in the information your table is sharing, and it can be especially useful for people who may get distracted or interrupted easily. They are also useful for people who may lose their place within a large table, such as a screen reader user or someone with a learning or intellectual disability. The easier you can make it for readers to understand what they’re analyzing, the better.

Despite this, only **4.32% of pages** with tables provide captions.

# Compatibility with assistive technologies

## Alternative text on images

Images are an essential part of the web experience. They can tell powerful stories, grab attention, and elicit emotion. But not everyone can see these images that we rely on telling parts of our stories. Thankfully, in 1995, HTML 2.0 provided a solution to this problem: [the alt tag](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/). The alt tag provides web developers with the capability of adding a textual description to the images we use, so that when someone is unable to see our images (or the images are unable to load), they can read the alt text for a description. The alt text fills them in on the part of the story they would have otherwise missed.

Even though alt tags have been around for 25 years, **49.91% of pages** still fail to provide alt tags for some of their images, and **8.68%** of sites never use them at all.

## Captions for audio and video

Just as images are powerful storytellers, so too are audio and video in grabbing attention and expressing ideas. When audio and video is not captioned, users who cannot hear this content are missing out on large portions of the web. One of the most common things we hear from users who are deaf or hard of hearing is the need to include captions for all audio and video content.

Of sites using [<audio>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) or [<video>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) elements, only **0.54% (1 out of every 185 sites)** provide captions. Note that some websites have custom solutions for providing video and audio captions to users. We were unable to detect these and thus the true percentage of sites utilizing captions is slightly higher.

You can add captions to all video and audio by using the [<track>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Audio_and_video_delivery/Adding_captions_and_subtitles_to_HTML5_video) tag.

## Distracting content

Some users, such as those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or intellectual disabilities, might have difficulty concentrating on the same task for a long time. The last thing that such users would want to have to deal with is pages that include a lot of motion and animations, especially when such effects are not related to the task that the user is trying to accomplish, but are used purely for cosmetic or marketing reasons. At a minimum, users would want a way to turn all distracting animations off.

Unfortunately, our findings indicate that animations are quite common on the Web. **Around 21%** of the sites in our sample employ some form of motion or include some animations.

## Labels on interactive elements

The most common way that a user interacts with a website is through its controls, such as links or buttons, in order to perform an action such as navigating to another part of the website, or changing what is displayed on the current page. Many times, screen reader users are unable to tell what action a control, such as a button or a link, is going to perform once activated. The reason is often the fact that the control lacks a textual label. For example, it might convey its meaning only in a graphical way, such as a button displaying a left-pointing arrow to signify that it is the "Back" button, or showing an “X” to signify that it is the “Close” button.

In our sample, a lot of websites use buttons or links. From those, **only around a quarter, or 24.39%,** include textual labels with these controls. If a control is not labeled, a screen reader user might read something generic, such as the word "button," instead of a meaningful name such as “Search”. This makes it difficult for screen reader users to understand how to use the website.

Buttons and links are almost always included in the tab order and thus have extremely high visibility. Navigating through a website using the tab key is one of the primary ways through which users who use only the keyboard explore your website. So, if a user is moving through your website using the tab key, they will surely encountered all unlabeled buttons and links. which will negatively affect .

## The use of ARIA

One of the most popular and widely used specifications for accessibility on the Web is the [Accessible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/)[ Rich Internet Applications](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) (ARIA) standard. This standard offers a large array of additional HTML attributes to help convey the purpose behind visual elements (i.e., their semantic meaning), and what kinds of actions they’re capable of.

Using ARIA correctly and appropriately can be challenging, because any mistake in the use of an ARIA attribute has no visual effect on the page. Sometimes errors can be detected by using an automated validation tool, but generally they require hands-on use of real assistive software (like a screen reader). This section will examine how ARIA is used on the Web, and specifically which parts of the standard are most prevalent.

#### Popularity of ARIA attributes

Almost all websites in our sample are using valid ARIA attributes, while around 88% of them are using valid values for those attributes. The conclusion is that, superficially at least, there are relatively few egregious mistakes in the use of the ARIA standard. The question is then, how much of the standard is really being used? The following table shows the top ARIA attribute / value pairs:

## The "role" attribute

The "role" attribute is the most important attribute in the entire ARIA specification. It's used to inform the browser what the purpose of a given HTML element is (i.e., the semantic meaning). For example, a *<div>* element visually styled as a button using CSS, should be given the ARIA role of *"button"*.

Currently,** 46.91% of pages** use at least one ARIA role attribute. In Figure 4 below, we’ve compiled a list of the top ten most widely used ARIA role values.

![image alt text](image_6.png)

**_Figure 4_***.** Top 10 aria roles*

Alt text: For each of the following top 10 most used aria roles, what percentage of sites use them: navigation: 20.4%; search: 15.49%; main: 14.39%; banner: 13.62%; contentinfo: 11.23%; button: 10.59%; dialog: 7.87%; complementary: 6.06%; menu: 4.71%; form: 3.75%

Looking at the results in Figure 4, we can draw two surprising conclusions:

#### Updating UI frameworks could be the way forward for accessibility across the web

The top 5 roles, all appearing on 11% of pages or more, are landmark roles. These are used to aid navigation—not to describe the functionality of a widget, such as a combo box. This is a surprising result because the main motivator behind the development of ARIA was to give web developers the capability to describe the functionality of widgets made of generic HTML elements (like divs).

We suspect that some of the most popular web UI frameworks include navigation roles in their templates. This would explain the prevalence of landmark attributes. If this theory is correct, updating popular UI frameworks to include more accessibility support may have an outsized impact on the accessibility of the Web.

Another result that points towards this conclusion is the fact that more "advanced" but equally important ARIA attributes don't appear to be used at all. Such attributes cannot easily be deployed through a UI framework because they might need to be customized based on the structure and the visual appearance of every site individually. For example, we found that the posinset and setsize attributes were only used on 01% of websites. These attributes convey to a screen reader user how many items are in a list or menu and which item is currently selected. So, if a visually impaired user is trying to navigate through a menu, they might hear announcements like: "Home, 1 of 5", "Products, 2 of 5", "Downloads, 3 of 5", etc.

#### Many sites attempt to make dialogs accessible

The relative popularity of the *"dialog"* role stands out, because making dialogs accessible for screen reader users is very challenging. It is therefore exciting to see around 8% of the analyzed pages stepping up to the challenge. Again, we suspect this might be due to the use of some UI frameworks.

## Accessibility of Form Controls

Filling out forms is a task many of us to do every single day. From shopping, booking travel, or applying for a job, forms are the main way webpages gather information from users. Because of this, ensuring your forms are accessible is incredibly important. The simplest means of accomplishing this is by providing labels (via the [label element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label), [aria-label](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-label_attribute) or [aria-labelledby](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-labelledby_attribute)) for each of your inputs. Sadly, only **22.33% of pages **provide labels for all their form inputs, meaning 4 out of every 5 pages have forms that may be next to impossible to fill out.

### Indicators of required and invalid fields

When we come across a field with a big red asterisk next to it ***** , we know it’s a required field. Or when we hit submit and are looking back through the form, anything highlighted in a different color needs to be corrected and then resubmitted. However, people with low or no vision cannot rely on these visual cues, which is why the HTML input attributes *required, aria-required* and* aria-invalid* are so important. They provide screen readers with the equivalent of our red asterisks and red highlighted fields. **PLUS, **as a nice bonus, when you inform browsers what fields are required… they’ll [validate parts of your forms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Form_validation) for you. No javascript required.

Of pages using forms: **21.73% use required or aria-required** when marking up required fields. Only one in every five sites make use of this. This is a simple step to make your site accessible, and unlocks helpful browser features for all users.

**_Note: _**We also found 3.52% of sites with forms make use of *aria-invalid.* However, since many forms only make use of this field once incorrect information is submitted, we could not ascertain the true percentage of sites using this markup.

### Duplicate IDs

IDs can be used in HTML to link two elements together. For example, the [label element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label) works this way. You specify the ID of the input field this label is describing and the browser links them together. The result? Users can now click on this label to focus on the input field, and screen readers will use this label as the description.

Unfortunately, **34.62% of sites have duplicate ids**, which means on many sites the ID specified by the user could refer to multiple different inputs. So when a user clicks on the label to select a field… they may end up [selecting something different](https://www.deque.com/blog/unique-id-attributes-matter/) than they intended. I’ll leave it up to your imagination to think about how bad this could be in something like a shopping cart 😞.

This issue is even more pronounced for screen readers, because their users may not be able to visually double check what is selected. Plus, many ARIA attributes, such as [aria-describedby](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-describedby_attribute)  and [aria-labelledby](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-labelledby_attribute), work similarly to the label element detailed above. So to make your site accessible, removing all duplicate IDs is a good first step.

# Conclusion

**P**eople legally defined as having a disability are not the only ones with accessibility needs. For example, anyone who has suffered a temporary wrist injury has experienced the difficulty of clicking small tap targets. Eyesight often diminishes with age, making text written in small fonts challenging to read. Finger dexterity is also not the same across age demographics, making tapping interactive controls or swiping through content on mobile websites more difficult for a sizable percentage of users.

Similarly, assistive software is not only geared towards people with disabilities. For instance, drivers would benefit from a screen reading functionality that, while they keep their eyes on the road, reads long pieces of text like news stories aloud. The recent popularity of voice assistance, both on mobile devices and in the home, has demonstrated that controlling a computing device using voice commands is desirable, and at times essential, for a large number of users. Voice commands like these used to only be an accessibility feature, but is now turning into a mainstream product.

Once a website is built, it’s often hard to retrofit accessibility on top of existing site structures and widgets. Accessibility isn’t something that can be easily sprinkled on afterwards, but needs to be part of the design and implementation process. Unfortunately, either through a lack of awareness, or easy to use testing tools, many developers are not familiar with the needs of all their users and the requirements of the assistive software they use.

While not conclusive, our results indicate that the use of accessibility standards like ARIA, and good accessibility authoring practices (e.g., the use of alt text) are found on a *sizable, but not substantial,* portion of the web. On the surface this is encouraging, but we suspect many of these positive trends are due to the popularity of certain UI frameworks. On one hand this is disappointing because web developers cannot simply rely on UI framework to "infect" their sites with accessibility support. On the other hand though, it’s encouraging to see how large of an effect UI frameworks could have on the accessibility of the Web.

The next frontier, in our opinion, is making widgets that are available through UI frameworks more accessible. Since many complex widgets used in the wild (e.g., calendar pickers) are sourced from a UI library, it would be great for these widgets to be accessible out of the box. What we hope are hoping for, is when we collect our results next time, the usage of more complex ARIA roles is on the rise—signifying more complex widgets have also been made accessible.
